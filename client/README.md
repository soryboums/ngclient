# ngclient front end

ngclient is a kickstarter for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) projects. This is a clone of Josh David Miller project on github [ngbp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) with packages up to date and the exclusive use of npm intsead of using both npm and bower.

In this project I also implement an user management using json web token on an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) / [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) server.

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/ngclient-folder/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy coding!
